## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can be started using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch` (jest)
- every exercise has it's own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO` comments inside of the source code (eg `// TODO 1: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise


## Reference solution
You can always compare your solution with the `exercise-finished` project which contains
working solution for every previous exercise


## How to use Jest in "watch" mode

- `a` - to run all tests
- `w` followed by `p` - to run only specific files (regexp, eg `todo.comp` will run `todo.component.spec.ts` file)
